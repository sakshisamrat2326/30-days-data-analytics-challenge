# 30-Day Data Analytics Challenge

## Description
This repository documents my **30-day Data Analytics challenge**, designed to develop **practical analytics skills** for campus placements and real-world projects. Each day focuses on specific topics, exercises, and mini-projects, covering the full analytics workflow from data cleaning to visualization and insights.

The challenge covers:
- Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Working with Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and SQL
- Creating dashboards and reports
- Mini-projects using real datasets
- Tips, tricks, and best practices for efficient analytics

## Features
- Day-wise structured learning plan
- Hands-on exercises with real datasets
- Mini-projects to apply analytics concepts
- Placement-oriented tasks and insights
- Cheat sheets and productivity tips

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL / SQLite)
- Excel / Google Sheets
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Git & GitHub for version control
